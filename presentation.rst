www.sgvlug.org
==============

- Hosted on Github

  - Source
  - HTML

- Generated by a static web generator

  - A program that generates HTML pages from some sort of markup language and templates.

----

Why Github
=========

- Free
- Version controlled
- Anyone can edit the site
- Solves problem of single point for access
- Only failure point is having domain pointed at it
- Need only a Python, a text editor and git to modify

----

We are Using Pelican
====================

- Python based static site generator
- Write content with either Markdown, reStructuredText or AsciiDoc
- Very active community
  - Freenode IRC #pelican
- Many themes and plugins available
- http://docs.getpelican.com/

----

Getting Started
===============
    
Install Pelican and ghp-import

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

    $ pip install pelican
    $ pip install ghp-import

Checkout source (read only)

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

    $ git clone https://github.com/sgvlug/website.git sgvlug_website

If you are added to access list you can clone this way:

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

    $ git clone git@github.com:sgvlug/website.git sgvlug_website

----

Creating a New Post
===================

Open an editor to create a new post:

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

    $ vim content/posts/2014-02-13-lightning-talks.md

I am tending to name the file with the event date in the filename. The date in the post should be when it was written.

----

Creating a New Post
===================

The contents of the post need at least the Title and Date meta data in the header. Contents of the post is regular Markdown below the header lines.

.. sourcecode:: markdown

    Title: Lightning Talks
    Date: 2014-02-13 22:33

    Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

    2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, `monospace`. 
    Itemized lists look like:

      * this one
      * that one
      * the other one

----

Testing Website
===============

Pelican includes a small development server so you can see what the site will look like when you deploy it. Run the following:

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

   $ make devserver

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/

----

Deploying Website
=================

Once you are satisfied with the changes, use git to save your changes and upload to Github:

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

    $ git add content/posts/<your_new_file>.md
    $ git commit -m "What I did here was add a new post"
    $ git push origin master


Deploying to github is made easy using ghp-import and Pelican's Makefile:

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

   $ make github

----

Easy Way to Make Posts
======================

Since we are using the SGVTech Meetup Group, I made a script to easily convert the contents of the meetup events into Markdown for Pelican. It also adds some meta data about the event data and location.

----

Obtain meetup2md
================

Download meetup2md from Github and initialize it's submodules:

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

    $ git clone https://github.com/omwah/meetup2md.git
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

----

Authorize meetup2md
===================

We need to set up OAuth so the script can access Meetup. Create a new consumer key and secret here:
http://meetup.com/meetup_api/oauth_consumers

Set up authentication with the program:

.. sourcecode:: shell-session
    
    $ meetup2md.py --consumer <key> <secret>

Hit allow on the web page that is loaded by the script. Now pass the verification code to the script:

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

    $ meetup2md.py --verifier 183742

----

Configure meetup2md for LUG
===========================

Edit the [events] section of app.cfg to allow us to easily to filter out SGVLUG events:

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

    [events]
    group_name = SGVTech
    name_filter = SGV Linux Users Group Monthly Meeting
    title_cleanup = ^SGV Linux Users Group Monthly Meeting -

----

Creating an Article from a Meetup Event
=======================================

From the sgvtech_website directory you can create a post for the SGVLUG meetups scheduled within the next month:
    
.. sourcecode:: shell-session

    $ meetup2md.py -t ,1m -o content/posts

* -t indicates a time range
* -o specifies where to output files

----

Creating an Article from a Meetup Event
=======================================

You will see something like this:

.. sourcecode:: shell-session

    Name: SGV Linux Users Group Monthly Meeting - Lightning Talks
    Title: Lightning Talks
    Time: Thursday February 13, 2014 07:00 PM
    Venue: Burger Continental, 535 S Lake Ave, Pasadena, CA, 91101
     -> content/posts/2014-02-13-lightning-talks.md
    ----

----

Finishing Up
============

Load up the devserver to check the post, commit if everything looks fine.
